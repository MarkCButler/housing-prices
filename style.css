/*************************************************************
 * Rules to approximate a slate-style theme.
 *************************************************************

 * The color scheme used for this report is similar to the slate theme
 * available in R shinythemes.  However, the slate theme is not available for
 * R markdown.  Here is the method that I used to get an approximation to the
 * slate theme:
 *
 * 1. Select the built-in yeti theme based on fonts, font sizes, and
 * arrangement of tabset elements.
 *
 * 2. Download the CSS file for the slate theme from shinythemes:
 *
 * https://github.com/rstudio/shinythemes/blob/master/inst/shinythemes/css/slate.min.css
 *
 * 3. From the CSS for the slate theme, find the color and background-color for
 * the body tag and set these to have the same value in the current file.
 *
 * 4. As might be expected, there were some problems with the style of the
 * resulting html (although relatively few for the markdown file that I was
 * concerned with).  Using the browser's developer tools, find the CSS rules
 * associated with the problematic elements.  Where possible, simplify and/or
 * combine these rules to point to the elements needing to be changed.
 *
 * Then tweak these elements (and possibly others as well) according to taste.
